# About me

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Statistics at [UC Davis](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu). I am broadly interested in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning.

I received my BA and MA in Statistics at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu), where I was supervised by [Alexander Petersen](https://statistics.byu.edu/directory/petersen-alex), [Guo Yu](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/guo-yu), [Sang-Yun Oh](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/sang-yun-oh), and [Wendy Meiring](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/wendy-meiring) on particular projects. Before coming to UC Davis, I worked at the [Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Imaging Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/machine-learning-biomed-data/) at the University of Pennsylvania.
